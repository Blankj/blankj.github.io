### Description

Donald wishes to send a gift to his new nephew, Fooey. Donald is a bit of a traditionalist, so he has chosen to send a set of N classic baby blocks. Each block is a cube, 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch. Donald wants to stack the blocks together into a rectangular solid and wrap them all up in brown paper for shipping. How much brown paper does Donald need?

<!-- more -->
### Input

The first line of input contains C, the number of test cases. For each case there is an additional line containing N, the number of blocks to be shipped. N does not exceed 1000.

### Output

Your program should produce one line of output per case, giving the minimal area of paper (in square inches) needed to wrap the blocks when they are stacked together.

### Sample Input

<pre>5
9
10
26
27
100</pre>

### Sample Output

<pre>30
34
82
54
130</pre>


分析：枚举，堆积起来的体积为i*j*k，则num%（i*j）肯定为整数，然后更新表面积得到最小即可。

``` cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include<vector>
#include<cctype>
#include<cmath>
#include<cstring>
#include<cstdio>
using namespace std; 
void solve();
int main()
{
	solve();
	return 0;
}
void solve()
{   
	int t,i,j,m,num,ans,now;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
		ans=999999999;
		cin>>num;
		for(i=1;i<=num;i++)
		{
			for(j=1;j*i<=num;j++)
			{
				if(num%(i*j)!=0)
					continue;
				m=num/(i*j);
				now=i*j+i*m+m*j;
				if(now<ans)
					ans=now;
			}
		}
		cout<<ans*2<<endl;
	}
}
